 *         Problem 6.
 *         The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 *         The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 =
 *         3025, Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
 *         numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the
 *         sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 *
 *         Answer: 25164150
